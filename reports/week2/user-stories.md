## US-01: Basic Packet Counting

**Requirement status:** Active
**MoSCoW priority:** Must Have

As a network administrator,
I want to see the total number of packets received and transmitted by the Traffic Processor on the web interface in real time,
so that I can quickly verify that the TP is correctly seeing traffic on the network segment.

## US-04: Collect and Display Per‑Connection Statistics

**Requirement status:** Active
**MoSCoW priority:** Should Have

As a network administrator,
I want to see, for each source‑destination pair, the number of connections and the ports used on the web interface,
so that I can detect unusual connection patterns.

## US-05: Block Traffic Based on a Blacklist

**Requirement status:** Active
**MoSCoW priority:** Could Have

As a network administrator,
I want to define a list of incoming/outcoming connections separatly to block/allow, and have the TP drop those packets,
so that I can prevent access to known malicious or undesirable destinations.

## US-06: Traffic Statistics History

**Requirement status:** Active
**MoSCoW priority:** Could Have

As a network administrator,
I want to view history of packet and connection data with timestamps, all stored in software's database,
so that I can produce audit reports or investigate past incidents.

## US-07: Tunnel Selected Traffic to a Remote Gateway Node

**Requirement status:** Active
**MoSCoW priority:** Could Have

As a network administrator,
I want to designate certain traffic to be encapsulated and forwarded through Gateway Node,
so that my traffic appears to originate from the gateway's location.

## US-08: Export Packet Captures for External Analysis

**Requirement status:** Active
**MoSCoW priority:** Could Have

As a network administrator,
I want to download a PCAP file of traffic that passed through the TP,
so that I can analyse suspicious traffic with tools like Wireshark.

## US-10: Plug‑and‑Run

**Requirement status:** Active
**MoSCoW priority:** Should Have

As a home user,
I want to physically connect the TP device between my router and the internet, power it on, and have it start working with default rules without any configuration,
so that I can run the software without deep network knowledge.

## US-11: Deploy TP as a laptop/microcomputer

**Requirement status:** Active
**MoSCoW priority:** Should Have

As a network administrator,
I want to have the possibility to run the Traffic Processor inside a separate laptop/microcomputer,
so that I can increase traffic capacity of the component.
